This tool is specifically designed to generate PCR (Put-Call Ratio) signals, providing clear BUY and SELL indicators based on market conditions. The PCR is a valuable metric that helps traders assess market sentiment and make informed decisions. By analyzing the ratio of put to call options, this tool aims to give you timely signals for potential trading opportunities. While it serves as a useful guide, it's important to remember that no tool is flawless, and market conditions can change rapidly. Always use the signals in conjunction with your own research and risk management strategies.
